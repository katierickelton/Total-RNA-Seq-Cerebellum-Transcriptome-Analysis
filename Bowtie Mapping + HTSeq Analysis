Section 3: Bowtie + HTSeq Analysis

Bowtie2 is used to map reads to assembled transcriptomes.

1. Run Bowtie2 on individual human read files:

bowtie2 -p 6 -q -x /Volumes/tempoandmode/PFCEP/bowtie_index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38 -U /Volumes/tempoandmode/htcf.wustl.edu/files/6X3qJmdV/FASTQ_FILES/WholeSampleSequences/human15.fastq -S /Volumes/tempoandmode/PFCEP/CerebellumProject_KR/bam_files/human/Human15.sam
bowtie2 -p 6 -q -x /Volumes/tempoandmode/PFCEP/bowtie_index/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38 -U /Volumes/tempoandmode/htcf.wustl.edu/files/6X3qJmdV/FASTQ_FILES/WholeSampleSequences/human1.fastq -S /Volumes/tempoandmode/PFCEP/CerebellumProject_KR/bam_files/Human3.bam

**Both of these produced great alignment statistics (about 95% of reads mapping to human annotated genome). 

2. Run Bowtie2 on Marmoset catenated read files:

bowtie2 -p 6 -f -x /Volumes/tempoandmode/PFCEP/bowtie_index/Callithrix_jacchus.ASM275486v1 -U /Volumes/tempoandmode/htcf.wustl.edu/files/6X3qJmdV/FASTQ_FILES/WholeSampleSequences/Marmoset_Trinity_Files/Trinity.fasta -S /Volumes/tempoandmode/PFCEP/CerebellumProject_KR/bam_files/Marmoset1.bam

**Produced 94% alignment score (great) against annotated genome. 

HTSeq allows us to count reads that map to specific features. In the case of our transcriptome data, we want to map reads to genes, that we have from annotated genome data (gtf files). 

3. Run HTSeq on SAM file from Bowtie2 mapping of entire human catenated read file:

  913,871 total reads

  __no_feature	645953
  __ambiguous	12019
  __too_low_aQual	64125
  __not_aligned	53170
  __alignment_not_unique	0

** We surprisingly have many reads (in some cases around half) that are not mapping to any particular features ("genes"). 
** Looked at these reads that were mapping to no features: put them in a separate file and blasted a random selection of these
** Found that many appeared to be low complexity-reads that consisted of extremely repetitive regions, and thus did not map to anything
** Led us to using the DUST feature, but that only filtered out a small fraction of these reads.
** Not sure if there is a good way to actually take these "no-feature" reads out because this might disrupt the read assembly in trinity/mapping to the reference genome.

**Saw similar statistics that was reported for the human HTSeq data
**Compared these distributions to previously analyzed datasets and found that 50-60% mapping to no feature is pretty normal
**Not something that we will likely have to worry about in our analysis.
